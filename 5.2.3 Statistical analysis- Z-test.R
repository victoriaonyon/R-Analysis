# Grandfathers Clocks, a small family business, which was founded in 1920. 
# In preparation for the 100-year celebrations, we have been tasked to determine
# whether the then-CEOâ€™s promise to the stakeholders was honoured. 
# The CEO promised that the business would sell on average 250 watches per year.
# This project complies a data set (watches.csv) that consists of two randomly 
# selected stores from different locations, a hundred values per store (), 
# normally distributed data, and a standard deviation of 12.26 and 30.15 for 
# Store_A and Store_B respectively. She decides to perform a one-sample and 
# two-sample -test on annual sales data.
